#### NEXPIN

#### Step 1: Project Setup
Create a new Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializer or your preferred IDE to create a new Spring Boot project.
Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and any other necessary dependencies.
Database Setup:

Define the database schema based on the provided entities (User, Role, Accounts, Account_Type, Card, Transactions, Transaction_type, Transaction_details, Services, Cashback).
Use Spring Data JPA to create repository interfaces for each entity.
Entity Classes:

Create Java classes for each entity and annotate them with @Entity and define relationships using JPA annotations.
#### Step 2: User Authentication and Authorization
Implement User Authentication:

Use Spring Security to implement user authentication.
Create a UserDetailsService to load user details from the database.
Configure security settings in the application properties or class.
Role-Based Authorization:

Implement role-based authorization using Spring Security annotations.
Define custom access rules for different endpoints.
#### Step 3: User Registration and Management
User Registration:

Create REST endpoints for user registration.
Implement a service to handle user registration and save user details in the database.
Password Management:

Implement a forgot password feature using email verification.
Allow users to reset their passwords.
#### Step 4: Implement Banking Operations
Account Management:

Implement endpoints for adding and deactivating accounts (admin functionality).
Allow users to view their active accounts.
Transaction Handling:

Implement endpoints for fund transfers, payments, and transaction history.
Apply business rules such as cashback for specific criteria.
Microservices Architecture:

Design and implement microservices for different functionalities (user management, accounts, transactions, etc.).
Use Spring Cloud for service discovery and communication.
#### Step 5: Testing
Unit and Integration Tests:
Write unit tests for service and repository classes.
Create integration tests for testing the entire flow of transactions.
#### Step 6: Documentation and Deployment
API Documentation:

Use tools like Swagger or Spring RestDocs to document your API endpoints.
Create a Video Presentation:

Record a video demonstrating the functionality of your online banking platform.
Highlight key features and functionalities.
Deployment:

Deploy your Spring Boot application to a cloud platform or your preferred hosting environment.
#### Step 7: Post-Deployment
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging for your application.
Use tools like Spring Boot Actuator and external logging frameworks.
Security Improvements:

Regularly update dependencies.
Monitor and address security vulnerabilities.
Remember to follow best practices, modularize your code, and use design patterns where applicable. Additionally, consider implementing error handling, validation, and input sanitation throughout your application.

Testing:
Unit and Integration Testing:
Write thorough unit tests for all your entities, services, and utility classes using JUnit and Mockito.
Conduct integration tests to test the interaction between various components and microservices.
6. Front-end Development:
   If not already in progress, begin the development of the front-end application that will interact with your backend, using a framework that suits your preference (e.g., Angular, React).
7. Documentation and User Guides:
   In-Code Documentation:
   Ensure that your code is well commented and understandable.
   API Documentation:
   Use tools like Swagger or Spring Rest Docs to create comprehensive API documentation.
   User Guide:
   Start drafting a user guide or help documentation for end-users of the platform.
8. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
   CI/CD Pipeline:
   Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
   Automate your testing and deployment processes to streamline your workflow.
9. Security Enhancements:
   Review and Reinforce:
   Conduct a security audit of your application, ensuring all endpoints are secure, data is encrypted, and proper authentication and authorization are in place.
   Implement rate limiting, SQL injection prevention, and other security best practices.
10. Performance Optimization:
    Database and Queries:
    Optimize your database interactions and queries for better performance.
    Application Optimization:
    Profile your application and optimize bottlenecks.
    Review and Iterate:
    Regularly review your progress against the roadmap.
    Adapt your plans based on testing feedback, new requirements, or challenges faced during development.
    Keep stakeholders updated with progress and any changes to the timeline or scope.
